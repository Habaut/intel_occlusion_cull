# Software Occlusion Culling

This is just a repository where I toy around with Intel's "Software Occlusion Culling": http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/samples/software-occlusion-culling

All the interesting code is in the branches.

I make no guarantees that any of this code is good for anything in particular. I just felt like tinkering with the code a bit and this is where I put the results.
